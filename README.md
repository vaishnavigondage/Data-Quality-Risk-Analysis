## 📐 KPI Definitions

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| Total Clients | Record count of client rows |
| Total Loan | Bank Loans + Business Lending + Credit Card Balance |
| Total Deposit | Bank Deposits + Checking + Saving + Foreign Currency Account |
| Checking / Saving Accounts | Sum of the balances |
| Business Lending | Sum of business lending amounts |

**Validation (joined 2021, female):** 107 clients, Total Loan 164.35M, Total Deposit 142.85M, Checking 37.82M, Saving 24.08M, Business Lending 98.43M. Power BI and Looker Studio match.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vaishnavigondage/banking-analysis.git
```
2. Install Python libraries
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/`.
4. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop to see the dashboard.
5. **Looker Studio version:** create a BigQuery dataset `banking_kpi`, upload the four CSVs from `data/`, run `sql/create_view.sql` to create `v_clients`, then connect Looker Studio to that view.

## 📌 Note

- Data is sample/synthetic, not real banking data.
- GitHub won't preview `.pbix` directly. Use Power BI Desktop.
- The BigQuery sandbox deletes tables after a limited time, so the live Looker link may stop updating. The screenshots show the finished dashboard.
- This is Looker Studio, not the full Looker platform, so there is no LookML in this project.
